# Here is a start point...

To be honest, I have been admiring those who have a well-regulated online garden of their own. Please Imagine that you have an idyllic house among tremendous skyscrapers--How excellent the feeling is! Constructing a personal blog also brings me the amazing feelings akin to it--You divided a space which is purely clean from this well-polluted world, guarding your precious thoughts underneath your deepest mind. Since several years ago, the idea that to build a personal blog have been being slipped into my idea part, however it is hidden for some reasons...

# Several chances for reemergence
That I come up to recall this personal blog idea is simultaneously inspired by many considerations.
One is that my worries about my writing skills. I have participated in 2 composition contest recently, John Locke Essay Competition and Harvard International Review Academic Writing Competition. These 2 contest for me is obviously......extremely hard...( smile face :) ) Except for those contest bits, I know very well about how essential the writing skill is in future life -- In high school, I have to take Ap capstone, which is an introductory course in academic research. Also, essay is everywhere, in contest, exams, homework assignments... Not to mention what I need to write in college and future working..., It must be more various and frequent. -- So,I started to ponder on my English composition and deduce some improvement methods. It is definitely a nightmare for me...though, I have to **make** it. 

Another, a more motivated one, is to share my meditation and record my track. Several month ago, I created a **meditation memo**. It include various contents. I have written some life thoughts, complains, even enlightening conversations or small moments of regret. Once I have something pop into my brain, I will immediately open this document and record them as detailed as possible -- because ideas fly off easily... Continue doing this, I found that...I am making progress...somewhen and somewhere. This is very satisfactory, which provide me an amazing motivation to keep working. Inspired by this good habit, I started to write more things as I believe writing is an excellent way to hold precious thoughts and memories and keep them from being washed away. For example, I would have a week summary at every Sunday and list the task in next week after it, which helps me very well have sense of total control on my daily life. I also want to write something every day, in order to keep my brain activated. And, As you may think, these naturally pushes the blog idea back to surface. 


Here today, 25th, July, 2023, I have finished this little blog site. Only 8 hours from deciding. 

I hope this project will be both beneficial, at least a little bit, for me and you guys who love pondering.
