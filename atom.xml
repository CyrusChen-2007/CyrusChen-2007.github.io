    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p><img src="https://s2.loli.net/2023/07/26/TIRbCWSHP9wQivK.jpg"></p><h1 id="Here-is-a-start-point…"><a href="#Here-is-a-start-point…" class="headerlink" title="Here is a start point…"></a>Here is a start point…</h1><p>To be honest, I have been admiring those who have a well-regulated online garden of their own. Please Imagine that you have an idyllic house among tremendous skyscrapers–How excellent the feeling is! Constructing a personal blog also brings me the amazing feelings akin to it–You divided a space which is purely clean from this well-polluted world, guarding your precious thoughts underneath your deepest mind. Since several years ago, the idea that to build a personal blog have been being slipped into my idea part, however it is hidden for some reasons…</p><h1 id="Several-chances-for-reemergence"><a href="#Several-chances-for-reemergence" class="headerlink" title="Several chances for reemergence"></a>Several chances for reemergence</h1><p>That I come up to recall this personal blog idea is simultaneously inspired by many considerations.<br>One is that my worries about my writing skills. I have participated in 2 composition contest recently, John Locke Essay Competition and Harvard International Review Academic Writing Competition. These 2 contest for me is obviously……extremely hard…( smile face :) ) Except for those contest bits, I know very well about how essential the writing skill is in future life – In high school, I have to take Ap capstone, which is an introductory course in academic research. Also, essay is everywhere, in contest, exams, homework assignments… Not to mention what I need to write in college and future working…, It must be more various and frequent. – So,I started to ponder on my English composition and deduce some improvement methods. It is definitely a nightmare for me…though, I have to <strong>make</strong> it. </p><p>Another, a more motivated one, is to share my meditation and record my track. Several month ago, I created a <strong>meditation memo</strong>. It include various contents. I have written some life thoughts, complains, even enlightening conversations or small moments of regret. Once I have something pop into my brain, I will immediately open this document and record them as detailed as possible – because ideas fly off easily… Continue doing this, I found that…I am making progress…somewhen and somewhere. This is very satisfactory, which provide me an amazing motivation to keep working. Inspired by this good habit, I started to write more things as I believe writing is an excellent way to hold precious thoughts and memories and keep them from being washed away. For example, I would have a week summary at every Sunday and list the task in next week after it, which helps me very well have sense of total control on my daily life. I also want to write something every day, in order to keep my brain activated. And, As you may think, these naturally pushes the blog idea back to surface. </p><p>Here today, 25th, July, 2023, I have finished this little blog site. Only 8 hours from deciding. </p><p>I hope this project will be both beneficial, at least a little bit, for me and you guys who love pondering.</p>]]></content>
